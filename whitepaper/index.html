                                  <p>This paper proposes the Polycoin Asset, an economics structure which constitutes a decentralized meme project with a purposed $PLYC as a Utility Token. We are thus introducing the investors and customers to a genuine passive income scheme using our native Polycoin token. Since we are based on the BEP-20 technology, this consequently eliminating energy and computational waste while ensuring distributed fairness through a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus, we are also proposing not only a highly profitable procedure by acquiring and holding $PLYC, but also by participating in different launchpads vetted and proposed by our team of experts. </p>

                                <p>Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance. These include statements relating to future actions, prospective launchpad products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results.</p>

Our statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown present or future risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining our actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and they may be adversely affected by factors, including general market conditions, competitive product development, product availability, current and future branded and generic competition, federal and state regulations and legislation, service availability issues, timing of trades, patent positions, litigations, and investigations. Our actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about the performance of the token.

							   <p>$PLYC Token was born in 2022 with the vision to make the record by growing token price. 
                                   The decentralized meme project came with the purpose of issuing $PLYC as a Utility Token. 
                                   Within the first 60 Days $PLYC will Launch Decentralized Swap and Initial Liquidity Offering Platform. 
                                 </p>
							   <p>Whilst it is assumed to be a meme token, what set is apart is that the Polycoin team comes up with a layer of practicality and usability beyond the simple existence of the token, adding a few relevant services, and thus creating a whole ecosystem. The differences between the $PLYC token and other meme cryptocurrencies on the market include the following:</p>

                               <p>Our token mechanics are structured so that there are a multitude of influences for material appreciation. Starting with growing transactions and constant onboarding of new clients we start to build a higher use for our token and a higher demand. With this kind of assistance to the velocity of our token along with its use in crypto trading, it can measurably reach its true intrinsic value.</p>
                               <p>With the growing use of the token by businesses on the platform we effectively reduce price risk relative to the dollar for all holders, setting a comfortable base for which we can assume, following price discovery on exchanges, our cryptocurrency will not fall through. This also sets the investment standard for traders to buy knowing that eventually, $PLYC tokens will reach certain support levels where there is only more upside as we grow.</p>
